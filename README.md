# first-challenge

This home page was built to showcase Horiseon's SEO services to prospective clients. Clients now have clear and easy access to Horiseon's staff, as well as gaining an understanding of what the firm may offer. As a developer, this website gave me a clearer understanding of semantic HTML and clean, well-organized CSS.
